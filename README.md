DICOMcloud is a highly customizable, open source DICOMweb server that implements RESTful services in DICOM part 18

The DICOM Web server implementation uses Unity as a Dependency Injection (DI) framework to build the server components. You can extend any of these components or completely roll out your own then plug it in using your DI framework of choice. The implementation takes advantage of this architecture by providing two options for media storage: 
 1. Local File System: A module that support storing and retrieving media files to a local file system storage using the Windows File API in .NET 
 2. Azure Blob Storage: A module that uses the Azure Storage library for storing DICOM files and any other media to Azure Blob storage.

You can do the same with the database implementation for example to replace the existing implementation or customize it to integrate with your own database and traditional DICOM server. 

# Hosted server endpoints and demo
I'm maintining an online version of the server, check the wiki [Home](https://github.com/Zaid-Safadi/DICOMcloud/wiki) page for endpoint Urls 

There is a client Demo that I open sourced and hosting:

# Deployment To Azure
In order to simplify the deployment of the DICOMcloud server to Azure an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template is created on the repository root [azuredeploy.json](https://github.com/Zaid-Safadi/DICOMcloud/blob/development/azuredeploy.json).

This template can be utilized to deploy the DICOMcloud server to your Azure subscription in multiple ways. The ARM template will take care of creating the database, the storage account, the website and configuration.

Precisely the template will create the following resources in Azure:
 1. A SQL Server with Single SQL Database. ~$5/month
 2. Standard Storage Account. ~$0.1/month 
 3. Free Tier App Service Plan. Free
 
# Implementation
The server code is written in C# .NET 4.5.2 and Visual Studio 2015. The web services are built as ASP.NET REST WebApi Controllers.
Check the [code and project's structure](https://github.com/Zaid-Safadi/DICOMcloud/wiki/Code-and-Projects-Structure) wiki page for more details.

Physical DICOM storage is supported on both, either Windows File System or Azure Blob Storage.

Query is currently implemented against a SQL database and compatible with Azure SQL Database

Implementation natively support JSON and XML DICOM format.

# DICOM Support
The code is designed to be a complete DICOM web server implementation with storage, query and retrieve capabilities.

For detailed information about the supported services and features, check the [DICOM Support](https://github.com/Zaid-Safadi/DICOMcloud/wiki/DICOM-Support) wiki page
